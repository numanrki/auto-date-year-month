* This plugin adds the following short codes to your WordPress Blog/Site:

* **[cy]** - Stands For [Current Year] This would output the current year, the previous year, and the next year in the post, like this: (e.g. 2024)
* **[py]** - Stands For [Previous Year] Outputs the previous year (e.g. 2023)
* **[ny]** - Stands For [Next Year] Outputs the next year (e.g. 2025)
* **[today]** - Stands For [Today Full Date] Outputs the Full Date, month and year  (e.g. November 09, 1994)
* **[tomorrow]** Stands For Next Day Full Date e.g, (Today is **April 16, 2024** it will show the **April 17, 2024** using simple shortcode **[tomorrow]**)
* **[cd]** - Stands For [Current Date] Outputs the Current Day  (e.g. 27)
* **[pd]** - Stands For [Previous day] Outputs the Previous Day  (e.g. Thursday)
* **[day]** - Stands For [day] Outputs the Current Day  (e.g. Friday)
* **[nd]** - Stands For [Next day] Outputs the Previous Day  (e.g. Saturday)
* **[cm]** - Stands For [Current Month] Outputs the Current Month (e.g. December)
* **[nm]** - Stands For [Next Month] Outputs the name of next month  (e.g. This month is December when you use given shortcode output must be January)
* **[pm]** - Stands For [Previous Month] Outputs the name of previous month  (e.g. This month is December when you use given shortcode output must be November)

== [offset] ==
* This shortcode will display a previous or future date based on an offset from the current date. Usage: **[offset date="OFFSET"]**, where **"OFFSET"** is an integer representing the number of days before **(-)** or after **(+)** the current date. Examples:
1. **[offset date="-1"]** will display the previous date based on the user's timezone. Example output: **"May 4, 2023"**.
2. **[offset date="0"]** is equivalent to **[today]** and will display the current date. Example output: **"May 5, 2023"**.
3. **[offset date="1"]** will display the next date based on the user's timezone. Example output: **"May 6, 2023"**.
4. **[offset date="365"]** will display the date one year from the current date based on the user's timezone. Example output: **"May 5, 2024"**.


== Countdown short and Countdown ==
* These shortcodes will display a live countdown to a specified date, either in a compact or detailed format, based on the shortcode used. The countdowns will update in real-time, showing the remaining time until the target date provided by the user.
Usage:
**[cdown_short date="mm/dd/yyyy"]:** Displays the countdown in a short format (e.g., "84d, 7h, 26m, 38s").
**[countdown date="mm/dd/yyyy"]:** Displays the countdown in a full format (e.g., "84 days, 7 hours, 26 minutes, 38 seconds").

**Examples:**

**[cdown_short date="12/31/2024"]:** Shows the time remaining until December 31, 2024, in a short format: "84d, 7h, 26m, 38s".
**[countdown date="12/31/2024"]:** Shows the time remaining until December 31, 2024, in a detailed format: "84 days, 7 hours, 26 minutes, 38 seconds".
**[cdown_short date="06/01/2025"]:** Displays the time left until June 1, 2025, in a short format.
**[countdown date="06/01/2025"]:** Displays the time left until June 1, 2025, in a detailed format.

* Shortcodes to display live countdowns in a short or detailed format, depending on user input.
**[custom_countdown_short hours="value"]:** Countdown in a compact format (e.g., 2d, 5h, 30m, 45s).
**[custom_countdown_full hours="value"]:** Countdown in a full format (e.g., 2 days, 5 hours, 30 minutes, 45 seconds).

**Examples:**

**[custom_countdown_short hours="48"]:** Displays 2d, 0h, 0m, 0s.
**[custom_countdown_full hours="12"]:** Displays 0 days, 12 hours, 0 minutes, 0 seconds.


Note that the date format is "F j, Y" (e.g. "May 5, 2023"). You can modify this format by editing the `show_previous_dates()` function in the `functions.php` file.
