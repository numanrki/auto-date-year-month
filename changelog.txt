== Changelog ==

= Version 2.0.2 =

Release Date: **October 13, 2024**

New Features:
- **Added [cdown_short]** shortcode for a compact countdown format (e.g., "84d, 7h, 26m, 38s").
- **Added [countdown]** shortcode for a detailed countdown format (e.g., "84 days, 7 hours, 26 minutes, 38 seconds").
- **Added [custom_countdown_short]** shortcode for a compact countdown format (e.g., 2d, 5h, 30m, 45s).
- **Added [custom_countdown_full]** shortcode for a detailed countdown format (e.g., 2 days, 5 hours, 30 minutes, 45 seconds).

Security Fix:
- **Fixed vulnerability** allowing arbitrary shortcode execution in comments by unauthorized users. Shortcodes are now disabled in comments, and only authorized users (Contributor+ roles) can execute them. User input is sanitized and output is escaped for enhanced security.
  
Special thanks to **Francesco Carlucci** for responsibly disclosing this vulnerability.
